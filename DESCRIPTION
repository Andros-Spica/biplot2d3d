Description: This package allows the user to generate fully-customized two and three
    dimensional scatter plots, especially ordination plots or biplots.
    For example, it can be used for displaying the first two/three principal
    components of a Principal Components Analysis (points), together with
    the respective variable loadings (arrows). Mainly, the ade4 and rgl packages
    are used to built 2d and 3d plots, respectively. The biplots2d3d package
    centralizes the control over many options available in these packages
    (and others), organizing them exhastively into parameters of higher level
    functions, such as biplot2Dim and biplot3Dim.
